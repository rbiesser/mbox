- I just found out that the Python Extension for VSCode makes it convenient to run Python code in two ways in addition to the normal Terminal execution. Both allow for running a block of code independently of the rest of the document. Both are available for you to try.
1. Jupyter Notebooks
    - Allows for Markdown comments.
1. Interactive Window
    - Code blocks are separated by `#%%` which does slightly clutter the readability and also only works in VSCode.
